As already mentioned, NocoDB, as a so-called no-code database, combines the ease of use of a spreadsheet 
with the flexibility of a relational database. It does this by providing an interface, the website, 
which is based on a ‘classic’ relational database such as Postgreql or MySQL. Fortunately, it is not necessary 
to understand exactly what this means in order to use it, an advantage of no-code databases. Put simply, 
a database is created and all the complicated and difficult commands that previously had to be carried out by 
programmers can be used via the website interface, including the creation of these. At the same time, 
it is also possible to use your own database and place NocoDB on top of this existing database to make 
further work with it easier. We will now take a look at exactly how this works. 
 To make it as easy as possible to get started, we will use the online version of NocoDB in this lesson, 
 which can be found [here](https://app.nocodb.com/). However, it is also possible to host your own version 
 of NocoDB, either locally on your own computer or on a server. 

To be able to use NocoDB, you must first create an account and then log in with it. Once this is done, 
we land on the NocoDB homepage.
