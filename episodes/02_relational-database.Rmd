- normalize data in tables

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In order to approach the topic as a whole, we first want to look at and understand the individual components in detail. 
As already mentioned, so-called keys are used to link tables in relational databases and thus make data storage and 
analysis more efficient. What exactly this means is explained below.

## Tables (Relations)

Tables are a fundamental tool for organizing and processing data in a structured way. 
They consist of rows and columns, much like what you're used to seeing in spreadsheet programs like Excel. 
Each column represents a specific attribute or characteristic—such as “Name,” “Date of Birth,” or “Email Address.” 
Each row represents a single data entry, showing the actual values for those attributes. More precisely, each column 
would represent a person and contain information about that person. This concept is transferable to all types of objects.

Bill Traylor | 1.4.1854


Tables provide a clear and easy-to-understand structure that works well for both humans and computers. They allow large 
amounts of information to be stored in an organized way, making it easy to search, sort, and analyze the data.

The widespread success of tables comes from their simplicity, clarity, and versatility. They can be adapted to many 
different types of data and serve as an ideal starting point for everything from simple lists to complex data analysis.


## Primary Key and Foreign Key

To structure and tidy up tables a little better, so-called keys are used in relational data modelling. What exactly 
this is used for will be explained in the next step. First of all, 
we want to understand what this concept actually means, as it is essential for the entire modelling process. These 
keys are used to create relationships between tables in the database 
and guarantee that each entry in a table can be uniquely referenced. If we think back to the tables for a moment, 
each column represents a data record, in our example a person. 
If we want to make this person uniquely referenceable, we can assign an ID. If this ID is unique and only exists once 
in the entire data record, it is referred to as the primary key.

Name | Date of Birth | **ID (Primary Key)**
----- | ----- | -----
Thomas Eakins | 25.7.1844 | 1
Bill Traylor | 1.4.1854 | 2

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- The primary Key must never be empty
- The primary Key must be unique

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

If we now want to collect more information about that some person, that we do not want to store in the same table, we 
can create a new table and refer to the person with the Primary Key. If we use this key in the new table
we talk about a foreign key. This key is therefore used to create a relationship between the two tables, or between 
two entries in the tables. This allows information to be split into different tables in order to structure 
them better and more clearly without losing information. 
The advantages of this and how it is used in relational data modelling need to be clarified next.

- A **foreign key** must link to an existing **Primary Key**

## Normal Form

# Introduction to Normal Forms – Bringing Order to Your Data

As the amount of information in a table grows, it's important to keep the data **well-structured and manageable**. 
This is where the concept of **normal forms** comes in - a systematic approach to organizing data so that it remains **clear, 
consistent**, and **easy to extend**.

Normal forms build upon concepts you already know: **tables (relations)**, **primary keys**, and **foreign keys**. 
They help avoid common issues in database design, such as:

- **Data redundancy**: storing the same information multiple times  
- **Anomalies**: unwanted side effects when inserting, updating, or deleting data  
- **Lack of clarity**: tables that are hard to maintain or expand

Imagine you want to add new features in the future — new fields, relationships, or more advanced queries. 
If your tables are well-structured, you can do that with minimal effort. In a simple "all in one table" it can be very difficult
to apply changes. Normal forms help create a **clean and flexible foundation** for your data.

Another key advantage: normalized data makes it easier to work with **relationships between tables**. 
The result is a model that is both **logically sound** and **technically efficient**.



::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Avoid duplication of data  
- Clear separation of responsibilities (each table has a specific role)  
- Fewer errors and inconsistencies  
- Easier to maintain and extend the database
